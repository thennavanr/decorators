Decorators
----------

Comparing and contrasting different styles of decorators in Ruby.

Class-Method-Missing Decorator
------------------------------

    rspec spec/class_method_missing_spec.rb

Benefits:

* delegates through all decorators
* can be wrapped infinitely using Ruby instantiation
* can use the same decorator more than once on the same component
* transparently uses component's original interface

Drawbacks:

* type is of the final decorator
* uses `method_missing`

How it's used:

    class Coffee
      include Component

      def cost
        2
      end

      def origin
        "Colombia"
      end
    end

    class Milk
      include Decorator

      def cost
        @component.cost + 0.4
      end
    end

    class Sugar
      include Decorator

      def cost
        @component.cost + 0.2
      end
    end

Module-Extend-Super Decorator
-----------------------------

    rspec spec/module_extend_super_spec.rb

Benefits:

* delegates through all decorators
* type is of the component
* has the original interface because it is the original object

Drawbacks:

* can not use the same decorator more than once on the same object
* difficult to tell which decorator added the functionality
* requires DSL like `decorate_with`

How it's used:

    class Coffee
      include Component

      def cost
        2
      end

      def origin
        "Colombia"
      end
    end

    module Milk
      def cost
        super + 0.4
      end
    end

    module Sugar
      def cost
        super + 0.2
      end
    end

Plain Old Ruby Object Decorator
-------------------------------

    rspec spec/plain_old_ruby_object_spec.rb

Benefits:

*  delegates through all decorators
*  can use same decorator more than once on component

Drawbacks:

*  cannot transparently use component's original interface
*  type is of the final decorator
